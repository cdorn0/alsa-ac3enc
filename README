Introduction
============

This library is a new implementation of an AC3 encoder plugin for ALSA. The standard a52 plugin stopped working
for me with newer versions of ALSA. It utilizes libaften (http://aften.sourceforge.net/) for the actual encoding.

Instead of the standard a52 plugin this plugin does not use the ALSA ioplug interface but the filter interface.
Thus timing and buffer underrun problems are avoided.

The latest code can be obtained from git:
 git clone git://github.com/cdorn0/alsa-ac3enc

Installation
============

To build the library, make sure you have ALSA, libaften and the corresponding development packages installed.

See the file INSTALL for the generic installation instructions.
Quick summary for UNIX-like systems:

If building from git:
 autoreconf -f -i -v       # only if building from git

./configure
 make
 su -c 'make install'

 For Ubuntu and Debian, it is necessary that you select the right libdir:
 ./configure --sysconfdir=/etc --libdir=/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu # Ubuntu/Debian 32 Bit
 ./configure --sysconfdir=/etc --libdir=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu # Ubuntu/Debian 64 Bit
